## 🍯 What is the Bee Guardian Project and what is it used for

Bee Guardian is a React web app with the goal of speeding up the process of checking beehives health and production by monitoring multiple factors such as weight, internal and external temperatures and humidity.This is possible with the presence of an electronic device installed inside the hive container which is sending new readings regularly.
<br/><br/>
This project allows the beekeepers not to have to wear a special suit and move every day or week to the location of the hive(s) just to check if they are in place and producing.
